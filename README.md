#Project Overview

This project applies regression modeling to the Diabetes dataset from sklearn.datasets to predict disease progression. Polynomial features and scaling are used to improve model performance.

# Models Used

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

#Key Results

Best model: Lasso Regression

Test R²: 0.516

Test RMSE: 50.63

Lasso outperformed the other models due to its regularization and feature-selection capabilities.
